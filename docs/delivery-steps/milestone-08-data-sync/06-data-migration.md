# Data Migration Tools

**Objective:** Provide tools for migrating data between storage systems.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement migration from local to cloud
- [ ] Support migration between user accounts
- [ ] Add UI for migration actions
- [ ] Validate data integrity after migration
- [ ] Write failing tests for migration logic before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for migration logic and UI
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all migration data
- [ ] Document all migration logic, environment variables, and usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- Data can be migrated between storage systems and is validated
- Data integrity is maintained and tested
- Migration options are available in UI and are accessible
- All migration data is validated and sanitized
- Automated tests (unit and integration) cover all migration logic and UI (80%+ coverage)
- Manual testing confirms all migration flows
- All new environment variables are documented in `.env.example` and loaded correctly
- Documentation is complete and up to date

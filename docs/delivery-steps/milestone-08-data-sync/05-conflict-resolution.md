# Conflict Resolution System

**Objective:** Handle sync conflicts between local and cloud data.

## Tasks

- [ ] Detect and resolve data conflicts
- [ ] Provide UI for conflict resolution

- [ ] Write failing tests for conflict logic before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for conflict logic and UI
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all conflict data and resolutions
- [ ] Document all conflict logic, environment variables, and usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- Conflicts are detected and resolved and are validated
- Users can resolve conflicts in UI and changes persist
- All conflict events are logged and tested
- All conflict data and resolutions are validated and sanitized
- Automated tests (unit and integration) cover all conflict logic and UI (80%+ coverage)
- Manual testing confirms all conflict flows
- All new environment variables are documented in `.env.example` and loaded correctly
- Documentation is complete and up to date

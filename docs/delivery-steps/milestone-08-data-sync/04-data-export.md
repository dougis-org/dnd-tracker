# Data Export Features

**Objective:** Allow users to export data to PDF and JSON formats.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement export to PDF and JSON
- [ ] Add UI for export options
- [ ] Support selective export by content type
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all exported data
- [ ] Write failing tests for export logic before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for export logic and UI
- [ ] Document all export logic, environment variables, and usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can export data to PDF/JSON and exported data is validated
- Exported data is valid, complete, and tested
- Export options are available in UI and are accessible
- All exported data is validated and sanitized
- Automated tests (unit and integration) cover all export logic and UI (80%+ coverage)
- Manual testing confirms all export flows
- All new environment variables are documented in `.env.example` and loaded correctly
- Documentation is complete and up to date

# User Permissions & Roles

**Objective:** Implement role-based permissions for collaborative features.

## Tasks

- [ ] Define roles and permissions (owner, editor, viewer)
- [ ] Enforce permissions in API and UI
- [ ] Add UI for managing roles
- [ ] Write failing tests for permission logic before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for permission logic and UI
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all permission and role data
- [ ] Document all permission logic, environment variables, and usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- Roles and permissions are enforced and are validated
- UI for managing roles is available and is accessible
- All permission and role data is validated and sanitized
- Automated tests (unit and integration) cover all permission logic and UI (80%+ coverage)
- Manual testing confirms all permission flows
- All new environment variables are documented in `.env.example` and loaded correctly
- Documentation is complete and up to date

# Real-time Infrastructure Setup

**Objective:** Configure Pusher or Socket.IO for real-time collaboration features.

## Tasks

- [ ] Set up Pusher/Socket.IO backend
- [ ] Integrate with app for real-time updates
- [ ] Secure connections and authentication
- [ ] Write failing tests for real-time messaging before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for real-time messaging and updates
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all real-time data and connections
- [ ] Document all real-time setup, environment variables, and usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- Real-time backend is configured, secure, and validated
- App receives real-time updates and is tested
- Messaging is reliable, tested, and validated
- All real-time data and connections are validated and sanitized
- Automated tests (unit and integration) cover all real-time messaging and updates (80%+ coverage)
- Manual testing confirms all real-time flows
- All new environment variables are documented in `.env.example` and loaded correctly
- Documentation is complete and up to date

**Objective:** Implement campaign sharing and multi-user access.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create campaign sharing model
- [ ] Add UI for inviting and managing users
- [ ] Enforce permissions for shared campaigns

- [ ] Write failing tests for sharing logic before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for sharing logic and permissions
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all sharing and permission data
- [ ] Document all sharing logic, environment variables, and usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- Campaigns can be shared with multiple users and are validated
- Permissions are enforced and tested
- Real-time updates work for shared campaigns and are validated
- All sharing and permission data is validated and sanitized
- Automated tests (unit and integration) cover all sharing logic and permissions (80%+ coverage)
- Manual testing confirms all sharing flows
- All new environment variables are documented in `.env.example` and loaded correctly
- Documentation is complete and up to date

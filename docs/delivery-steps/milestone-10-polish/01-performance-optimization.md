# Performance Optimization

**Objective:** Optimize application speed and efficiency for production.

## Tasks

- [ ] Profile and optimize slow components
- [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API calls
- [ ] Minimize bundle size and assets
- [ ] Write failing tests for performance before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for performance improvements
- [ ] Validate and document all performance metrics
- [ ] Document all optimization logic, environment variables, and usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- Page load time < 3 seconds and is validated
- App is responsive under load and is tested
- Performance improvements are measured, documented, and tested
- All performance metrics are validated and documented
- Automated tests (unit and integration) cover all performance improvements (80%+ coverage)
- Manual testing confirms all performance flows
- All new environment variables are documented in `.env.example` and loaded correctly
- Documentation is complete and up to date

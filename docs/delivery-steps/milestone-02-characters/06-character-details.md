# Character Detail Page

**Objective:** Implement a detailed view for a single character, showing all attributes and actions.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create character detail page component
- [ ] Display all character fields (abilities, classes, equipment, spells, etc.)
- [ ] Add edit and delete actions
- [ ] Show calculated fields (modifiers, proficiency bonus)
- [ ] Display multiclassing and spellcasting info
- [ ] Ensure detail page is accessible (ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all input (e.g., character ID)
- [ ] Write failing tests for detail logic before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Write tests for all detail logic (display, actions, accessibility)
- [ ] Document all new environment variables in `.env.example` (if any)
- [ ] Update documentation for detail page usage and features

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements (15 Total)

Core capabilities defined:

- Character creation with validation
- D&D 5e stat block calculation (modifiers, saving throws, AC, initiative)
- Multiclass level tracking
- Search and filtering (by name, class, race, level)
- Character editing and deletion (soft delete with 30-day recovery)
- Character duplication
- Tier-based usage limits (Free: 10, Seasoned: 50, Expert: 250)
- Upgrade prompts at 80% limit

### Key Entities

1. **Character** - Core entity with D&D 5e stats, owned by User
2. **Race** - System entity defining D&D 5e races with bonuses
3. **Class** - System entity defining D&D 5e classes with features
4. **User** - Existing entity with subscription tier

### Success Criteria (10 Total, Measurable)

- Users create character in < 2 minutes
- Character list loads 50 characters in < 1 second
- Search filters return in < 500ms
- 95% character creation success rate (low validation errors)
- 100% D&D 5e calculation accuracy
- Clear tier limit enforcement with upgrade option
- 90% of users complete creation without support tickets
- System supports 10,000 total characters across all users

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 2: Planning (Run `/speckit.plan`)

Will generate:

- `specs/003-character-management/data-model.md` - MongoDB schema design
- `specs/003-character-management/contracts/characters-api.yaml` - OpenAPI specification
- `specs/003-character-management/quickstart.md` - Implementation guide
- `specs/003-character-management/research.md` - Research findings
- `specs/003-character-management/plan.md` - Detailed execution plan

### Phase 3: Tasks (Run `/speckit.tasks`)

Will generate:

- `specs/003-character-management/tasks.md` - TDD-first implementation tasks
- Test suite breakdowns
- Implementation phases
- Refactoring opportunities

### Phase 4: Implementation (Run `/speckit.implement`)

Will execute tasks with:

- Failing tests first (TDD approach)
- Code implementation
- 80%+ test coverage
- Quality checks (lint, type-check, build)

## 📝 Assumptions & Dependencies

### Dependencies

- Feature 001 (Foundation) ✅ Complete
- Feature 002 (User System) ✅ Complete - Required for user ownership and tier limits

### Key Assumptions

- D&D 5e standard rules for ability scores, modifiers, proficiency bonuses
- Soft-delete pattern for character deletion (30-day grace period)
- Race/class combinations are not restricted (all PHB combinations valid)
- Ability scores manually entered (no rolling/point-buy in Feature 003)
- Each character owned by exactly one user (sharing added in Feature 017)
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM using existing patterns

## 🎓 Design Principles Applied

1. **User-Centric**: Specification focuses on what users need and why, not how to build it
2. **Independent Testability**: Each user story can be tested independently and delivers value
3. **Bounded Scope**: Clear boundaries with references to future features that depend on this
4. **Technology-Agnostic**: Success criteria don't mention frameworks, databases, or languages
5. **Measurable Outcomes**: All metrics are specific, quantifiable, and verifiable

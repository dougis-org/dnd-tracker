# AGENTS.md: Instructions for AI Agents

AI agents must comply with the repository constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) and all procedures in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- **Primary Source:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` defines workflow, quality gates, coding standards, and deployment practices.
- **Obligation:** Agents read it before acting, adopt updates immediately, and reference it when uncertain.
- **Alignment:** The constitution extends project-wide ownership—agents fix or roll back any regressions they introduce or expose.

**Summary:** Follow the constitution; execute every task exactly as `CONTRIBUTING.md` prescribes.

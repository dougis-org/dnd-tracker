# create issues for milestone

using the details in the milestone 1 folder
as well as the execution plan,
create GitHub issues for the work in milestone 1

label the issues as appropriate (creating labels as needed) and update both the individual markdown files and the execution plan with the GitHub issue # and link to the issue (follow the pattern of other steps and put the GitHub issue link at the start of the existing information)
Make sure you switch to the main branch and pull from remote, then create a working branch for the markdown changes and once all GitHub issues for the milestone are created, commit all the markdown updates and push, then open a PR to main to merge the changes
